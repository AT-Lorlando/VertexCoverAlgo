    []: # Description: An algo covering 99% of random graph.

    []: # Version: 1.0.0

## Usage:

`python main.py -h` # Show help

Gen: `python main.py -G`
use to see any steps of the algo on a pdf.

Print: `python main.py -P`
use to print the result of the algo on the terminal, any step detailed, for debuging or educational purpose.

Random: `python main.py -R`
use to generate a number (specified by -gn) random graph.

Graph number, graph size, and graph density: `-gn 5, gs 5, gd 0.5`
If you want special graph, you can use this parameters.

Brute force: `python main.py -B`
**Warning:** If you want to verified any vertexcover by the bruteforce algo. **This algo is not optimized, it's just a brute force algo.**

**NFA and PRINT COLOR import are optional.**
